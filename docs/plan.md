# HaikanPanic – Project Plan

**ハイカンパニック！** is a hyper-portable, browser-based CAD tool built for Japan’s piping (配管 / haikan) industry. Designed to be lightweight and intuitive, it works seamlessly across desktop and mobile, with touch support and isometric precision — all without requiring any installation.

---

## 🔭 Project Vision

- **Truly portable**: Runs on any browser — phones, tablets, PCs
- **Hybrid interface**: Draw isometric diagrams with a path to 3D conversion
- **Japan-specific**: Aligned with JIS haikan standards (sizes, flanges, pipe codes)
- **Expandable**: Future support for databases of specs, materials, and weights
- **Offline-ready**: Zero dependencies, small build size, PWA-compatible
- **Deployment-friendly**: Built to run on GitHub Pages or embed into internal apps

## 📦 Core Features (Planned)

### 📐 Haikan Component Integration
- Preloaded with Japanese pipe specs (VP/STPG/SUS)
- Weight, length, and flange DB
- Auto-fill diameters and tags

### 🧰 Smart Symbol Support
- Common fittings (bends, reducers, tees, valves)
- Visual icons snap to pipe lines
- Switchable line layers (e.g. 水, ガス, 空気)

### 🎥 3D Conversion Preview
- Export from isometric to simplified 3D (OBJ/GLTF)
- Three.js viewer for mobile/tablet visualization
- Optional height logic from 2D slope

### 🔧 Measurement and Tags
- Auto distance/angle labels
- Annotate node points or pipe IDs
- Direction-aware snapping with export

## 🤝 Who Is It For?

- 現場スタッフ (on-site workers)
- Drafting or pre-installation teams
- Trainees and vocational school students
- Developers building tools for the Japanese construction sector

---

## 🚀 Final Goal

To make **HaikanPanic** the go-to field-ready isometric CAD tool for Japanese piping professionals — a fast, offline-capable, touch-friendly app that eventually supports 3D export, spec tracking, and accurate standards integration.

> Built for the 現場. No mouse? No problem.

## 📱 Long-Term Deployment

While the browser version of **HaikanPanic** will remain free and basic for quick on-site use, we plan to release **full-featured versions** on:

- Apple App Store (iOS/iPadOS)
- Google Play Store (Android)
- Microsoft Store (Windows desktop/tablet)

These versions will include **advanced drawing tools**, **3D editing**, **full spec integration**, and **offline project storage** for professional teams.

> This hybrid licensing allows fast access in browsers, with optional upgrade paths for heavy-duty usage across all devices.
